          <p class="personal-statement">Growing up in London - one of the most affluent cities - yet living in an area marked by deprivation and social poverty underscored a great failing in our current economic system - the problem of wealth inequality. Living in a city of contradictions, I want to understand why such pernicious wealth gaps still persist and evaluate the success and efficacy of different economic theories in solving this perennial problem. <br><br>	
            The disproportionate suffering of the poor and vulnerable during the Covid-19 pandemic motivated me to learn more about wealth inequality. In ‘Capital in the Twenty-First Century’, Thomas Piketty presents a compelling analysis of wealth distribution and the structure of inequality since the eighteenth century. To mitigate against inegalitarianism, he proposes the imposition of a larger wealth tax, so that all stocks held by the ‘super’ rich will be taxed to aid a ‘fairer’ distribution of wealth. While this seems like a viable and noble solution, there is a risk of decreased economic growth as a consequence of decreased investment.<br><br>
                        
            While it seems apparent that citizens should lie at the heart of all commerce and finance decision-making, John Kay’s ‘Parable of the Ox’ encapsulates the way in which current markets often neglect social responsibility. The economist, Tim Harford - speaking on the ‘More Or Less’ podcast - criticises how over-complicated economic systems neglect the basic needs of its citizens. Given that the financial system forms a central infrastructure of modern economies and societies, I would relish the opportunity to develop my own understanding and knowledge in the utilisation of economic analysis to evaluate and improve the existing economic and fiscal policies in order to promote social justice.<br><br>
                        
            My interest in economics extends beyond my ethical and egalitarian concerns. My EPQ project, ‘How 9/11 impacted US Citizens and their economy’, allowed me to apply my knowledge of Behavioural Economics and explore the economic consequences of citizens’ altered perceptions of risk post-9/11. Fear translated into a reduction in air travel and tourism that lasted for nearly two years. I found it interesting to conclude the importance of resilience and accurate reporting in mitigating the economic consequences of a terrorist attack.<br><br>
                        
            Over the summer, I participated in the University of Cambridge - Economics Summer School in which Professor Tony Cockerill’s lecture on ‘The World Economy’ led me to think about the economic implications and benefits of neocolonialism. Frank’s ‘Dependency Theory’ posits the idea that developed nations become wealthy by exploiting the poorest nations. While this exploitative relationship has its roots in the practice of slavery and Western colonisation, the Western world’s domination of international trade perpetuates inequality and the reliance of less-developed countries on Western aid. My Ghanaian heritage and its recent independence from the UK in 1957, makes me curious to pursue an evaluation of dependency theory in relation to the development of the Ghanaian economy.<br><br>
                        
            In my capacity as Deputy Head Boy, I have enjoyed working with fellow students and staff to coordinate a mentoring programme for younger students to access academic and peer support. Having benefited from the SEO Advance programme, I recognise the importance of initiatives that foster mentorship and achievement. It is this collegiate atmosphere of academic rigour and support that I look forward to at university. I am excited about the opportunity to develop my understanding of Economics in an environment that will be both challenging and rewarding. <br><br>
